## What you will learn

- Fundamental {{<hl>}}R programming skills{{</hl>}}
- {{<hl>}}Geometric Metaphors for Visualization{{</hl>}} and how to apply them in practice
- Gain experience with the {{<hl>}}tidyverse package{{</hl>}}, including data visualization with {{<hl>}}ggplot{{</hl>}}

## Program overview

The idea here is that of a visual or graphic as a Geometric metaphor for different kinds of information. We will take information from diverse *source domains* such as *Ecology*, *Jewellery*, *TV shows*, *Geography*, to name a few, and use datasets from these domains to create ***geometric metaphors*** for them using R.

We will realize that the code in R reads almost like English.
