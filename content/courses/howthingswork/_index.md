## Program overview

CE: This Unit takes students on a journey of understanding the process of Personal Creativity and Structured Innovation.

We begin by using the idea of Flow, as a pathway between ever-increasing (creative) Complexity and Boredom as defined by Csikszentmihalyi. Childhood Games and Household Tasks will be examined to understand the aspects of Play and linked to the Bogost’s idea of “creative Rule Breaking” and “Playing Infinite Games” by James Carse. Bourdieu’s concept of Cultural Capital will be interpreted as one of the primary sources for an individual’s ideas. The MBTI / Big 5 Tool will be used to understanding ourselves, our abilities, strengths, traits and differences from others. Csikszentmihalyi’s idea of the Creative Domain, Field and the Creative Individual will provide structure for Creative activity.

Structured heuristic techniques based on de Bono's 6 Hat method will help us see how to perform Situational Analysis and Idea Generation, to help us take ideas from conception to execution. Use of Metaphors in Problem Solving will be motivated using Guilford and Wallas-Kogan Methods. 

The idea of “generalized metaphors” will introduce TRIZ (Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskhikh Zadatch), the Russian system of innovation and problem solving invented by Genrikh Altshuller. Altshuller's ideas of Generalized Problem Solving by borrowing ideas/memes/Metaphors from other Domains, his 8 Laws of Evolution of Products, his “Contradictions Matrix”, and (a few of) the 40 Inventive Principles derived from his analysis of patents, will be covered in gamified fashion. These will be linked to with David Perkin’s (Harvard Project Zero) ideas, and with Edward de Bono's methods to interpret, and design for, existing situations and products.  Hollywood movies that exemplify these ideas will be part of this course.

GS: The GS part of the course will include reading of several metaphoric Short Stories drawn from world literatures. These will dwell on problems, comparisons, and contradictions, which are core aspects of TRIZ.

GSK: Problem solving involves gathering of gathering data and defining problems in a given situation. In the GSK part of this course, we will engage a technological tool-based exploration of the metaphoric linkage between geometry and data. The tool is R / RStudio and we will look at several diverse data visualizations (graphs, networks, maps, sequence diagrams…) to define and examine problems. The method followed will be based on “PRIMM: Predict – Reuse – Infer – Modify – Make”, which will be connected with the TRIZ methodology. 

At the end of the course, students will work in groups to conduct plenary sessions where they will make presentations on their own Cultural Capital and Life Experiences, interpreted using TRIZ.
